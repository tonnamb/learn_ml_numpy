# Learn machine learning (ML) with NumPy
Just a repository sharing my journey of learning machine learning fundamentals
by implementing it in NumPy

# Algorithms
## Implemented
* Linear regression (linear_regression.py)
* Conditional random field (crf_pystruct.py)

# Getting started
Setup the python virtual environment by:
```
make pyvenv
```

Run the linear regression model by:
```
make linear
```

See `Makefile` for more commands that can be run.
